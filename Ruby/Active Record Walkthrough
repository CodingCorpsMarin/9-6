Intro to Active Record

Let’s get acquainted with active record.
Fork and Clone https://github.com/CodingCorpsMarin/active-record-intro-code-base-challenge

Open the repo and let’s check out what we can do with our new toy.

Rakefile:
bundle exec rake -T (for tasks) lets us know what we can do 

Install the Bundle gem

gem install bundler 

Gems are packets of code that are like tools for our toolbox. They are Ruby add-ons do specific things/make life easier from something really small to something really big. 

Bundler is a gem that installs ALL the gems in your gemfile at once.
You need to install all your gems before starting work on a project for the functionality to all work
Run bundler with bundle install

Create database in the command line with 
bundle exec rake db:create

Check version with 
bundle exec rake db:version 

Run specs with 
bundle exec rake spec (this is essentially your “learn” command”, in fact, I think it is, they just aliased it to “learn”)

Run migrations with
bundle exec rake db:migrate
Whenever you make changes to your database schema (structure), you have to migrate the changes 

Check version, run specs

This exercise has seed data (dummy database entries to get our database prepopulated), let’s get it onto our database
bundle exec rake db:seed

Test out our database associations in the console (irb)
bundle exec rake console 
Dog.all

Rollback our database (undo changes)
bundle exec rake db:rollback

Drop database
bundle exec rake db:drop
